The Quizzer is a web application that can be used in bars, sports canteens and maybe even prisons to play quizzes as a team. A pub quiz, basically.

A typical use in a bar would look like this:

- Players are placed in _teams_. A typical team would consist of anywhere between three and eight players, this is not critical to the application, however.
- A _Quizz Night_ typically has two to six teams participating.
- A Quizz Night consists of multiple _rounds_, each round contains twelve questions, chosen from three _categories_.
- Besides the teams there is also a Quizz Master who selects questions, approves or disproves answers and keeps the mood up using humour and enthusiasm.
- Every team shares a table and uses one team member's smartphone to submit answers.
- The Quizz Master uses a tablet to host the game.
- Finally, a large screen (e.g. a beamer) is used to display everyone's score, the current question and the teams that have answered this question.
- The Quizzer's questions require short answers. They are not multiple choice questions, but don't require long sentences either. For example: “What is the capital of Peru?” or “In what year did the Netherlands last win the world championship Clay Pigeon Shooting?”.
- The Quizz Master decides when a Quizz Night is over. When it is, the application selects the winners based on the results of all played rounds.

## Three Single Page Applications

The Quizzer actually consists of three SPAs:

1. The Team app

   This SPA runs on the smart phones of the teams and can do two things:

   - Apply as a team for the Quizz Night. Part of the application process is providing a team name. Your team then needs to be approved by the Quizz Master.
   - Display the current question and allow the team to enter and submit an answer.

2. The Quizz Master app

   This app runs on the Quizz Master’s tablet. With it, he or she can perform these tasks:

   - Start the Quizz Night and open it for applications.
   - Approve or reject team applications.
   - Start the Quizz with all the teams that have applied.
   - Start a Quizz Round (that has twelve questions) by selecting three categories (out of a list) and pressing the “Start Round” button, for example.
   - After a Quizz Round, decide whether to play another round or to end the Quizz Night.
   - Select the next question. This is an interesting screen that will be expanded upon under the [User Interface](#user-interface) header.
   - _Start_ the selected question by pressing a button. Only then will it show on the Score Board and each Team’s app. From that moment on, teams can submit their answers until the Quizz Master closes the question, again by pressing a button.
   - Read the answers that the teams have submitted. This way the Quizz Master can decide whether he or she allows an answer that has a spelling mistake, for example.

3. The Score Board app

   This app does not have any interaction, but shows in real time:

   - The progress: how many rounds have been played, how many questions we’re into a round.

   - The team names with their scores in ‘Round Points’ and the number of correctly answered questions per round.

     Round Points are awarded like this: After each round of twelve questions, the team that has the most correct answers is awarded 4 Round Points (RPs). The next best team is awarded 2 RPs and the third best team is awarded 1 RP. All other teams are awarded 0.1 RPs for their effort and company.

   - When a question is in progress (it has been started and is not yet closed, teams can still submit answers) the following information:

     - the question;
     - the category of that question;
     - which teams have submitted an answer, but not the answer itself.

   - When a question is closed, all the team answers are displayed. As soon as an answer is approved or rejected, this is also displayed and the team scores are updated.

## Technical

The Quizzer will use Mongo, Express, React and Node (MERN stack), supplemented with the WebSocket protocol (the use of Redux and/or Router is optional, and will result in a higher grade). All three Single Page Applications will be served by the same Node.js/Express server.

They are web apps that run on a phone or tablet’s browser. They are not to be native Android or iOS apps that could be distributed through the Google Play Store or the App Store.

The three SPAs use web sockets to communicate in real-time. Examples of this real-time communication are:

- when the Quizz Master _starts_ a question, it immediately appears on the team phones and the score board;
- when a team submits an answer, it will immediately be displayed on the Quizz Master’s tablet, and the score board will show that that team has submitted an answer.
- When the Quizz Master approves an answer, the score shown on the score board will immediately be updated.

The server can support multiple simultaneous Quizz Nights that might be held in different pubs, for example. To prevent teams from applying with the wrong Quizz Night (being held in a different pub) the teams need to enter a simple password in the application process provided by the Quizz Master.

## User Interface

You don’t have to design a polished UI, but do think about which screens the different apps are going to need and what they are roughly going to look like. Even the use of Bootstrap is optional, but definitely worth the effort.

A nice visual design can earn you a small bonus if the app already meets all the requirements in this document.

One thing is especially important to consider. It is important that the Quizz Master has some freedom in choosing the next question, to cater to his or her audience or to the mood of the moment. Design your own UI for the Quizz Master app that allows a Quizz Master to choose from a few questions from any of the three categories that round.

## Functional Requirements

This is an incomplete list of functional requirements:

1. Any question can appear only once per Quizz Night. When a question is done, it will not appear in the suggestions for the Quizz Master again.
   (Categories _can_ appear more than once per Quizz Night.)
2. Team names must be unique; no two teams can have the same name in one Quizz Night. Team names can not be empty.
3. After a team has submitted an answer, they can change their mind and submit another answer, providing the Quizz Master hasn’t closed the question yet. The answer submitted last counts.
4. Empty answers will be ignored. If a team inadvertently submits an empty answer, it will not show on the score board or for the Quizz Master’s.
5. When the Quizz Master rounds up the Quizz Night, the score board will show the teams that placed first, second and third, measured by the amount of Round Points. This final screen heavily emphasises the team that places first.

This list of requirements is probably incomplete. If you encounter a situation where the expected behaviour is not described by this document, keep the following guide lines in mind:

- Whenever there is one straightforward solution that you can implement within a reasonable time frame, go for it.

  A “straightforward” solution should be a solution that helps the application reach it’s goal (for everyone to have a good time) and is user friendly.

- If there are multiple straightforward solutions available that are all implementable within a reasonable time frame, pick the one you like best.

- If none of the solutions you thought up contributes to a good time or to the usability of the apps, present the problem to one of your teachers.

- If the only viable solutions look like they require a lot of time, please consult a teacher.

## Technical Requirements

This is an incomplete list of technical requirements:

1. _Required WebSocket and REST architecture_

   Deciding which part of the communication should be implemented using WebSocket and which part using plain old REST is by no means trivial. In theory you could build your entire application using only WebSocket.

   The recommended approach is to implement all communication involving Quizzer data using REST. Whenever the server has new data, use WebSocket to notify the clients and let the clients make a REST API call to fetch the data.

   This architecture is by no means the most efficient solution, but it makes it much easier to structure your app. Exclusively using WebSocket can easily lead to a nasty mess. Besides, we really want to have all that caching possibilities of HTTP traffic.

2. _Validation_

   Any user-friendly app should have all input validated to avoid having inconsistent data. But this is not just a client-side concern; all data received by the server should be treated suspicious and validated again – after all: you can never really trust the client. You can use mongoose or mongo to help you with this.

3. _Game state_

   All information about an ongoing quiz must be stored in the database. This includes team information, given answers, progress, etc.

4. _Software Guidebook – lite_

   Any application requires some kind of design or thinking ahead. For this assignment we require you to make a design – by means of a software guidebook – _before_ coding. Don’t be scared: you don’t have to use any UML artefacts. However, this is a list of things that _must_ be included:

   - _Wireframes_ – Make (low-fidelity) wireframes of all pages of the applications. These are useful in knowing what to build and how to navigate between pages. You can extend these wireframes with information about the React components to use or build, WebSocket or REST communication that should be triggered, validations that must take place, etc. Don’t go nuts creating a pixel-perfect wireframe of mockup; 15-20 minutes for each page should be enough.

     Hint: use a tool like [Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn/) or [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) to create wireframes; [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is fine too.

     Hint: see [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) for an example of identifying React components from a wireframe / mockup.

   - _REST and WebSocket specification_ – Imagine you have to do some REST or WebSocket communication without knowing what the server expects or returns. Quite impossible.
     Create a consistent specification of the communication that takes place by REST or WebSocket between the client and server.

   - _Database schema_ – Of course you want to have some overview of which data is stored in the database; a schema greatly helps you with this. You can base your database scheme on the wireframes.

   - _Pack light. Travel fast._ – Feel free to extend this list and add those things you deem necessary for a software design. But remember – _pack light. travel fast._

Your teachers love Markdown. It’s quick, it’s easy, it’s plaintext and it’s ideal for keeping your guidebook in sync with your code. Every time you change some code that influences the design, you update the guidebook and include it with the code changing commit. _Hint:_ using the [right tools](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/) for Markdown you can even include a table-of-contents, images, diagrams, tables, etc.

Ideally, the teachers like to have a look at your design before you start coding. But don’t let them hold you down. As soon as you feel confident the design specifies enough details for you to start coding… please, start coding.

## Hints

- _Cooperation and merge conflicts_
  When working together on a shared code base, merge conflicts are a part of life. You can mitigate the risk of this annoyance by defining clearly separated chunks of functionality and avoid working on the same chunk at the same time. An example of two chunks is the React- and the Express-part. But you could also define smaller or different chunks like components or pages.

  Try to merge your work often (at least daily). If you postpone merging until the end, you won’t suffer any conflicts until the final day. However, the merge conflict you’ll face then will probably be too big to solve before the deadline.

## Extra Features

When you’re confident that you’ve implemented all of the aspects mentioned in this document you can consider adding a few extra features. We award bonus points for these extra features, granted that your application would get a passing mark without them.

Feel free to add your own functionalities or rules. Here are a few ideas:

- _The team selfie_ — Use the HTML5 API to access the phone’s camera and allow the team to take a selfie that they can send with their team application. The photo can then be shown on the score board.

- _PhoneGap_ — It’s a lot easier than you think to wrap the client side part of an SPA in a native Android or iOS app. A tool that is often used for this purpose is called ‘PhoneGap’.

- _Funny badges_ — Allow the Quizz Master to send funny or encouraging badges to teams whenever he or she wants. Examples of this could be badges saying “Funny answer”, “Awkward typo”, “Fast and furious”, etc.

  The badges don’t need to count towards the final score.

- _Thinking time_ — Instead of having the Quizz Master manually close a question, you could implement a clock that starts counting down as soon as the question has started and closes the question when it reaches zero. The scoreboard could show this clock in real time.

- _History_ — The app remembers the teams, allowing competition and rivalry that spans multiple Quizz Nights.

- _Automated test_ – Mongoose models and/or Express routes are automatically tested by test scripts that make use of Mocha (or any other framework).
